<h3>Armour</h3>
<p>Armour gives DT and DR if you have both DT and DR apply DT before DR</p>
<p>Damage Reduction (DR) reduces incoming damage by a flat amount. For example, if you have DR 5 and take 10 points of damage, the DR reduces the damage by 5, so you only take 5 points</p>
<p>Damage Threshold (DT) is the minimum amount of damage that must be dealt in a single attack to cause harm. If the damage doesnâ€™t meet or exceed the threshold, the attack is ineffective. For instance, if your DT is 8 and an enemy deals 7 damage, you take no damage</p>
